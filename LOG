sometimes huggler does not work one way, that's why users should sync both ways when connection is established.
IDEA: possible speed up. Multicast frames are kept by router. go to sleep and wake up every 10 minutes. Broadcast wakeup times. for battery saver... might need to hack jmdns ;-(
remember to check that chat messages are synched when springboard activity is not on the top
chat over opportunistic communication now works
next steps: encryption, bluetooth
OK, QR code now work + I managed to wrote a nice code to swich view (reflection is awesome!)

NEXT STEP: use elliptic curve crypto to encode messages. 
NEXT PROBLEM: connection refused - rewrite to make sure you are closing all sockets, check out stack overflow question.

NEXT STEP: should probably move keypair to separate SpringBoard database.
NEXT STEP: Make RSA work with Padding.
MILESTONE: The project now allows to chat over local network and use qr codes to exchange public keys and share messages.
